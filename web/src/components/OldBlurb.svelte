    Located in the historic Mill Hill Park of Trenton, NJ, sixtomidnight
    production studios offers a rapidly evolving, state-of-art marriage of
    digital and analog gear for all of your recording and creative needs. This
    balance of analog and digital elements is a dichotomy that we do our best to
    explore in every facet of every service that we offer. We have a true love
    for everything analog, as the warmth and character that it provides is what
    gives any recording that vintage feel; however, the effect of rapid
    advancement in audio technology cannot be understated—the ability to process
    vast amounts of sensory information within a digital audio workstation, on
    the fly, is changing the way we produce media.
  </p>
  <h2>Music Recording and Production</h2>
  <p>
    We have accrued extensive knowledge of methods to record, and utilize, a
    wide array of session instruments in multi-tracked recordings. From sax to
    vibraslap, we accommodate musicians, of any skill level, by providing the
    right microphone and a stellar atmosphere to extract and capture solid
    performances. As weathered instrumentalists ourselves, we can drop a
    bassline, or guitar riff to help fill-out arrangements; and if not us, we
    can co-opt another session instrumentalist from our network of extremely
    talented musicians; we seek, more than anything else, to community-build and
    help art support art. During out client consultations, we listen to intent
    with the hope of actualizing those ideas and, maybe, expanding the scope.
    Sometimes, the singer/songwriter actually wants more than their keyboard and
    voice on their record. We have and will continue to accumulate “the toys” to
    provide us, and our clients, with fresh production avenues. Along with our
    ever-growing cache of guitars, bass, uke, banjo, keys, percussion, etc., we
    have an appreciation of electronic instruments that is near geek-level. We
    can and will fill out arrangements, score TV/film, or create jingles
    efficiently while using our full arsenal of electro toys, if necessary. Our
    studio is not genre-specific. We have wide-ranging experience in the
    production of rock, hardcore, punk, electronic, alternative, hip-hop, rap,
    R&B, folk, progressive, and every sub-genre in between.
  </p>
  <h2>Audio Meets Video</h2>
  <p>
    We recognize entertainment as a fluid binding of senses. The experience of
    music is most enjoyed as the combination of audio and visual elements; they
    feed each other. As such, our interest in visual accompaniments is
    ever-present in our approach to potential clients; we can deliver
    video-recording/editing, co/ghost writing, photography, art (in various
    mediums), as well as digital/analog editing, branding and distribution.
    Whether the need is for some rap lyrics over a prerecorded beat with a music
    video and album art, or a video advertisement for a local business with
    originally scored music, we want to say yes. As every need is unique,
    flexibility is a hallmark of each of our various audio/visual services.
    Moreover, while our physical address is in Trenton, if necessary, our studio
    is fully mobile and we can travel to document and/or produce events or
    performances—regardless of location the fidelity of our recordings remains
    consistent. With this in mind, often the best performances are achieved when
    the performer is comfortable, and there is an enriched environment to craft.
    This is why we have done our best to create an immersive atmosphere at the
    studio to bolster the creative process.

  <h2>Marketing Makes, the World Takes</h2>
  <p>
    For the veteran or the beginner, the recording session is something
    important—a step to make permanent the sounds they make or hear. This is why
    every session, either in Trenton or elsewhere, can be captured with creative
    photography and multiple and dynamic camera angles for future editing, as
    well as be live-streamed to audiences on Facebook or YouTube. The whole
    experience, we firmly believe, is worth remembering and sharing. Depending
    on intent, marketing to a larger audience and branding content is a vital
    step in allowing entertainment-based media to have staying power.
    Photography is a huge part of our in-house marketing; whether we are taking
    artistic headshots or snapping energetic shots of music in motion,
    demonstrating the process of artistic creation is one of the many valuable
    marketing methods we employ. Our network of graphic designers can produce
    and distribute high-quality branded content (stickers, posters, etc.), and
    our relationships with numerous venues, public and private, makes building a
    local presence possible and tenable. Applying guerilla techniques has become
    somewhat of an art-form for us, bleeding into our love of artist-community
    development. Deferring the cost of marketing, or coupling it with paid
    advertising, is easier when the community is actively contributing. Another
    way to make a movement stronger is by seeking and collaborating with
    like-minded creators. Building up individuals and then combining multiple
    efforts toward a common goal is a huge source of progress. It is our goal to
    make sure that any vision has all of the components necessary to succeed;
    this usually involves persistence first, and recognizing and manipulating
    the status quo to break through it. We come across unique performers
    routinely, and with our collective years of experience in marketing and
    advertising in our day-jobs, we have found that promotion, itself, is an
    art. By staying current on the shifting state of multimedia flux, we enjoy
    treading new ground and are prepared to identify and explore your specific
    needs in engaging with hypermedia.
  </p>
  <h2>Come Hang</h2>
  <p>
    We cannot emphasize enough the importance of community (although we have
    tried) and the positive effect that this focus can have on society. This is
    why we are committed to serving our community with events that bring various
    forms of art together: stay connected through Facebook and Instagram for
    upcoming events. If your intention is to host a private event, any and all
    of the attention to detail that we seek in our aforementioned services are
    available to make the occasion as memorable as possible.
